Add the foundations for overlays and navigation: `LufiaProvider` (a `linkComponent` adapter and aria-only `labels`) with `useLufia` and `LufiaLink`; the hooks `useFocusTrap` (APG dialog focus handling, optional `inert` background), `useMediaQuery` (SSR-safe), `useModalState` (modal state in the URL through a router-agnostic adapter), `useDismiss`, `usePagination` and `useStepDirection`; and `VisuallyHidden`. `useBodyScrollLock` now compensates the scrollbar width in document mode; its API is unchanged.
